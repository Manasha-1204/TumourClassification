# TumourClassification
**Tumour classification using SVM and Logistic regression**

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Performing image classification on MRI scan images of the human brain using the scikit-learn
    library to train and evaluate the two classification models. Namely, Logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM). 
    Classification of MRI scans to verify whether they show any sign of brain tumour or not. We are also going to be demonstrating 
    the process of training and evaluating classification models along with visualisation to display images and their predicted
    classes.  </p>

The main components of tumour classification are: 
<ul>
  <li>Preprocessing the acquired dataset</li>
  <li>Splitting them into testing and training datasets</li>
  <li>Followed by training and evaluation</li>
</ul>
